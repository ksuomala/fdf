Aims of my FdF project

	Learn and discover the basics of graphics programming and concepts like line drawing and different projections.
	Learn the basics of MLX library.

For the user:

	Usage: ./fdf input_file.txt/fdf

	Input file will define the geometry of the map. I handle the input file as an above parallel view of the map. The
	altitudes are represented with numbers seperated by whitespaces.

	All inputs will be converted to integers from characters. Spacing rules will work according to man atoi. Maps with
	lines of different lengths will work.
